## Hi! ðŸ˜„

Developing advanced AI could cause bad things. I want to make sure it goes well.

Right now I'm developing my skills, aiming towards ML Engineer/Research Engineer. 

Currently I have one complete project:

[Classifying Practices in Privacy Policy Text](https://github.com/calhinchcliffe/nlp_privacy_policies) (Data Science, NLP)

I'll add to my portfolio as I work on more projects.
